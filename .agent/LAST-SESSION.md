# LAST-SESSION.md — Kahramana Baghdad
> Session 132: P4-2 checkout error localization + F-01 GA4/Clarity consent gating + /dashboard/catering listing + birthday notification (cron route + email template + wa.me). Master `c4fe9a8` → `d24e5e3`.
> Date: 2026-05-17
> Author: Claude Code (Opus 4.7, 1M context)

## SESSION 132 — SUMMARY

Five commits on master, all pushed. No migrations. All gates clean on
every commit: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx tsx scripts/check-i18n.ts`,
`NEXT_BUILD_WORKERS=1 npm run build`.

Theme: clear the named launch-prep backlog. Two carry-forwards from
session 131's audit (P4-2 raw English in checkout, F-01 consent
gating), then two new dashboard/notification surfaces (catering
listing + birthday email). One operator action added (CRON_SECRET);
no operator actions cleared.

The F-01 work surfaced a real violation that a pure UI audit would
have missed — the script tags were already consent-gated, but two
`<link rel="preconnect">` tags in <head> were still leaking
DNS + TLS to googletagmanager.com and clarity.ms on every first
paint regardless of consent.

The birthday work split cleanly into two commits as specified — a
scaffold (route + cron config + env var) followed by the actual
sending (template + wa.me + i18n).

## COMMITS (5 on master, all pushed)

| Hash | Type | Summary |
|------|------|---------|
| `9a93fe1` | fix(checkout) | **P4-2 — localize all 7 raw-English checkout errors.** Carry from session 128's `points_over_cap` work. Seven server-side strings in `src/app/[locale]/checkout/actions.ts` collapsed to stable lowercase codes consumed by `localizeCheckoutError` in `CheckoutForm.tsx`. Codes: `min_redemption:<n>` (carries dynamic count via prefix-parse, `{points}` interpolation in i18n), `insufficient_points`, `coupon_invalid`, `price_mismatch`, `auth_required`, `order_creation_failed`. `fetchAndComputeCouponDiscount` had 10 internal validation strings (paused / expired / branch / time window / per-customer limit / etc.) — all collapsed to `coupon_invalid` so the customer sees one localized message. 5 new i18n keys × 2 locales; parity 2,394 → 2,399. Sibling audit: `reserve/actions.ts` and `catering/actions.ts` already use code pattern (clean); `waiter/actions.ts:222` carries `'Order creation failed'` literal but is a staff surface with different return shape (out of scope, flagged for follow-up). |
| `92c6fba` | fix(privacy) | **F-01 — gate GA4 + Clarity behind cookie consent.** Audit was verification-only by spec; violation found. `<Analytics>` was already properly consent-gated for script injection. The leak was two `<link rel="preconnect">` tags in `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx:236-241` rendered server-side for every visitor regardless of consent. Preconnect performs DNS lookup + TLS handshake — that's a third-party network request before user accepts anything. Fix moved both preconnects into `<Analytics>` next to the Script tags they exist to warm up. Edge cases verified: returning consented user (useEffect on mount → preconnect + script inject immediately), never-accepted user (state stays false forever → no third-party connection), any non-`'accepted'` localStorage value (strict equality → blocks). |
| `1d67b4a` | feat(catering) | **/dashboard/catering inquiry listing page.** Migration 160's `catering_inquiries` table had been writing leads since session 126 with only Supabase Studio reads. New server-component page at `src/app/[locale]/dashboard/catering/page.tsx` with `requireDashboardSection('catering')` (owner + general_manager only — catering leads carry personal info + budget, tight gate). Suspense wraps `CateringInquiriesList.tsx` which reads via `createServiceClient()` (RLS service-role-only, mirrors reservations pattern), orders by `created_at DESC`, limit 200. Cards show all 12 columns from the spec: name, short ref (last 8 hex, mono), phone, occasion, event date + optional time, guests (locale-aware), service type, area, preferred branch (resolved via BRANCHES → AR/EN name, "Any branch" fallback), budget ("—" fallback), notes, received timestamp. Fresh (<24h) gets a gold "NEW" pill. WhatsApp CTA via `buildCustomerContactLink` with bilingual greeting + short-ref. Sidebar entry under customers group reuses `<ReservationsIcon />`. New `catering` section in `rbac-ui.ts` (distinct from existing `inventory_catering`). 17 new i18n keys × 2 locales. |
| `29ac5f2` | feat(cron) | **Birthday notification scaffold — /api/cron/birthday-notify + Vercel Cron config.** Auth via `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` (header Vercel injects on scheduled fires); without `CRON_SECRET` env var, route 503s every request including the scheduled cron — missing secret can never silently leak. Idempotency: 2h `created_at` lookback on `birthday_point_credits` — wide enough to catch today's pg_cron batch (05:00 UTC) when this route fires 1h later (06:00 UTC = 09:00 Asia/Bahrain), narrow enough that yesterday's rows fall outside. Documented caveat: manual mid-window curl within 2h of pg_cron WILL duplicate (intentional operator action; one-line `notified_at TIMESTAMPTZ` migration available if duplicate-send becomes real). `vercel.json` gains `crons` array. `.env.example` gains a new VERCEL CRON section with `CRON_SECRET` block + `openssl rand -hex 32` instructions. This commit's response is `{found, notified:0, cutoff}` — scaffold only. |
| `d24e5e3` | feat(email) | **Birthday email template + WhatsApp deep-link notification.** New `emails/templates/BirthdayBonus.tsx`: bilingual single email, two stacked sections (RTL AR → divider → LTR EN), two CTA buttons (Visit Account + Continue on WhatsApp). PreviewProps included for `react-email` dev mode. `sendBirthdayBonus(to, subject, props)` added to `src/lib/email/send.ts` — same `send()` helper as every other transactional email, returns SendResult union, never throws. Route loop in `/api/cron/birthday-notify` replaces the scaffold's `notified:0` placeholder: per credit row fetch `customer_profiles` (name, email, points_balance, loyalty_tier) → skip silently if email null → build AR+EN copy via `getTranslations({ locale })` → `sendBirthdayBonus` → on failure log to Sentry with `stage: birthday_notify.send_failed` and increment `failed` (one bad row can't kill the batch). wa.me URL built once outside the loop: Riffa branch number (`customer_profiles` has no preferred_branch column) + bilingual pre-filled text URL-encoded. New top-level `email.birthday` i18n namespace: subject, heading, subheading {name}, pointsAwarded {points}, balance {balance}, tier {tier}, tierNames.{bronze\|silver\|gold\|platinum}, accountCta, whatsappCta, whatsappMessage, footnote. Parity 2,419 → 2,433. |

## INFRA NOTES

- **No new env vars used by checkout/F-01/catering**. Birthday notification
  introduces `CRON_SECRET` (operator action added to bridge).
- **No migrations.** Local↔Remote still paired at 162.
- **No new dependencies.** Email template reuses existing
  `@react-email/components` primitives and the four Kahramana* layout
  components in `emails/components/`.
- **Build size delta:** /api/cron/birthday-notify went from 420 B
  (scaffold) → 2.19 kB (full loop). /[locale]/dashboard/catering at
  2.19 kB / 245 kB first-load. Total pages 564 → 566.

## KEY DECISIONS / JUDGMENT CALLS

1. **`min_redemption:<n>` prefix encoding over an `errorParams` field on
   `CheckoutResult`.** Adding a new param object to the result type
   would have rippled through every consumer of `CheckoutResult.error`.
   The prefix-and-parse pattern keeps `error: string` intact and
   confines all parameter-extraction logic to a single branch inside
   `localizeCheckoutError`. Only one parameterized error currently —
   if more arrive, the convention is documented in the route comment.

2. **All 10 coupon-validation strings collapse to `coupon_invalid`.**
   Considered keeping `coupon_expired` / `coupon_paused` /
   `coupon_below_minimum` distinct for actionability. The task brief
   listed "Coupon invalid" as a single bucket; customer can see the
   coupon UI for the precise reason. Specific codes can be split in a
   follow-up if dashboard analytics needs them.

3. **F-01: moved preconnects into `<Analytics>` rather than deleting
   them.** Considered just removing both — the perf benefit is small
   when the Script tag triggers DNS on its own. Kept them inside
   `<Analytics>` so the gate is identical for both layers and the
   original perf intent (warm DNS just before script load) is
   preserved post-consent.

4. **Catering dashboard: read-only listing, no realtime, no filter UI.**
   Reservations page has Realtime + filter chips + status mutations;
   reservation flow has live operational urgency (turn the table,
   confirm seating). Catering leads land via the public form, get
   processed via WhatsApp, and don't have a status lifecycle worth
   tracking yet. A status workflow (replied / quoted / closed) can
   land in a follow-up session when the operator decides what state
   they want to track.

5. **Birthday notification: bilingual single email, not locale-targeted.**
   The simpler alternative (`customer_profiles.preferred_locale` column
   + locale-specific send) needs a schema change and a backfill
   heuristic. Bilingual body is zero-DDL and the existing customer
   audience reads both anyway. AR block renders RTL, divider, EN block
   renders LTR.

6. **Birthday idempotency: 2h `created_at` window, not a `notified_at`
   column.** A `notified_at TIMESTAMPTZ` column on
   `birthday_point_credits` is the bulletproof solution. The 2h window
   is the cheap solution. Picked cheap for soft-launch because: pg_cron
   fires at 05:00 UTC, Vercel Cron fires at 06:00 UTC — 1h gap means
   the window naturally bounds to today's batch. Documented in route
   comments + commit body. Migration is one-line away if duplicate-send
   ever happens.

7. **Birthday WhatsApp: default to Riffa branch number.** Customer
   profiles don't track a preferred branch. Riffa is the live default
   per `BRANCHES`; both branches share the same wa.me hand-off pattern
   used everywhere else.

8. **Two-commit split for birthday work.** Task brief specified the
   exact commit messages. Commit 1 (scaffold) is meaningful on its own
   — operator can set CRON_SECRET and verify the auth + read path end
   to end before any actual sends go out. Commit 2 (content) replaces
   the placeholder.

## VERIFICATION

- `npx tsc --noEmit` → clean on every commit
- `npx tsx scripts/check-i18n.ts` →
    - Post-9a93fe1: 2,399 = 2,399
    - Post-1d67b4a: 2,419 = 2,419
    - Post-d24e5e3: 2,433 = 2,433
- `NEXT_BUILD_WORKERS=1 npm run build` → green on every commit (564 →
  566 pages, /api/cron/birthday-notify + /[locale]/dashboard/catering
  registered)
- **No runtime verification of birthday cron** — needs CRON_SECRET set
  in Vercel and a real birthday matching today's Asia/Bahrain civil
  date to fire. Operator can manually curl the route after setting
  the secret to dry-run the path.
- F-01 verified by reading the four edge cases in `<Analytics>`
  through; not exercised in a real browser this session. Operator can
  confirm in Chrome incognito Network tab.

## DEFERRED / OPERATOR-PENDING

(updated for session 132)
- Supabase Free → Pro + Singapore migration.
- TAP keys (merchant approval pending).
- Staff accounts — 13 staff emails pending from owner.
- **CRON_SECRET on Vercel** (new this session) — required for birthday
  cron to fire. `openssl rand -hex 32`, then set Production + Preview.
- Resend domain verification for kahramanat.com (already pending;
  birthday cron + every other transactional email needs it).
- VAPID keys for driver push notifications.
- CONTACT_NOTIFY_EMAIL (optional).
- After staff accounts: flip `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_QR_LOYALTY_SCAN=true`.
- WhatsApp/email birthday notification surface — **shipped this
  session (29ac5f2 + d24e5e3)**. Surface is live; needs CRON_SECRET +
  Resend verification to actually deliver. Will fire next morning
  there's a customer birthday matching today's Bahrain date.
- /dashboard/catering page — **shipped this session (1d67b4a)**. Empty
  state will show until the public form starts collecting leads in prod.
- ~15 `as any` sites (AUD-V3-007/011) — P4 follow-up still open.
- Extend `localizeCheckoutError` to the remaining raw-English errors NOT
  in the named seven — `waiter/actions.ts:222` is the named follow-up
  (staff surface, different return shape).
- Catering audit findings #6 (no email fallback) + #8 (HTML5 validation
  balloon doesn't follow next-intl locale) — deferred since session 126.
- Catering occasion_type / service_type normalization — currently
  locale-rendered string.
- HIDDEN_BRANCHES cleanup follow-up — purely cosmetic.

## OPERATOR NOTES

- **Set CRON_SECRET before the first birthday cron fire.** Without it
  the route returns 503 to every request, including the scheduled
  Vercel Cron at 06:00 UTC. pg_cron will still credit points
  silently — only the notification leg is gated.

- **/dashboard/catering is live for owner + GM only.** Cashiers /
  branch managers / waiters won't see it in the sidebar (RBAC filter
  hides it). Reads via service-role per migration 160's contract.

- **F-01 fix is invisible to consented users.** Already-accepted
  visitors get the preconnect + script bundle the moment `<Analytics>`
  hydrates, same as before. First-time visitors get zero third-party
  connections until they tap Accept.

## SESSION 131 — SUMMARY

One commit on master. No migrations. Gates clean: `npx tsc --noEmit`.
No i18n touched (parity script not run — nothing to check).

Theme: clear a single deferred item that's been carried since session
101. The CLAUDE-AI-CONTEXT.md hand-off named `SetPasswordClient.tsx`
as the orphaned file; investigation showed it had already been
removed in an earlier pass (only docs still referenced it). The
sibling `ForgotPasswordClient.tsx` was the actual orphan — page
mounts `ForgotPasswordForm` from `@/components/auth/`, and grep
across `src/` + `app/` found zero references to the `Client`
variant. Deleted; 144 LOC gone.

No operator actions cleared this session. The three from session 130
(`SESSION_BIND_SECRET`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` rotation, redeploy) stay
recorded as done.

## COMMITS (1 on master, not pushed by Claude — push at operator discretion)

| Hash | Type | Summary |
|------|------|---------|
| `c4fe9a8` | chore | **P4-1 ForgotPasswordClient.tsx removed (144 LOC).** `src/app/[locale]/forgot-password/page.tsx` mounts `ForgotPasswordForm` from `@/components/auth/ForgotPasswordForm`. The sibling `ForgotPasswordClient.tsx` in the same route folder had zero references in source — verified via `grep -r ForgotPasswordClient src/ app/` returning only the file itself and `.agent/phase-state.json` (a stale note). `git rm` + `tsc --noEmit` clean. `SetPasswordClient.tsx` was named in the carry-forward note but Glob confirmed the file no longer exists — already cleaned in a prior pass. |

## INFRA NOTES

- **No new env vars introduced.**
- **No migrations.** Local↔Remote still paired at 162.
- **No new dependencies.**
- **No i18n changes** — parity stays at 2,394 ↔ 2,394.

## KEY DECISIONS / JUDGMENT CALLS

1. **Verified the carry-forward note before deleting.** Memory and
   docs both named `SetPasswordClient.tsx` as the orphan. Glob first
   — file was already gone. Then grepped for the actual orphan
   (`ForgotPasswordClient`) and confirmed `page.tsx` mounts a
   *different* component (`ForgotPasswordForm`, from `components/auth/`).
   Removing the wrong file based on stale docs would have been
   silently destructive.

2. **`git add` only the deletion.** `sync-context.ps1` had clobbered
   `.agent/CURRENT-SESSION.md` at session start with stale
   session-120 content from `CLAUDE-AI-CONTEXT.md`. Left that drift
   unstaged in the cleanup commit per `git add -p` project rule —
   sibling work doesn't ride along. Resolved separately in this
   close-out commit.

3. **No build run.** `tsc --noEmit` was sufficient gate for a pure
   deletion of a file with no inbound references. Build would have
   passed but added several minutes for no new signal.

## VERIFICATION

- `npx tsc --noEmit` → clean
- `grep -r ForgotPasswordClient src/ app/` (via Grep tool) → only
  the deleted file itself + stale `phase-state.json` reference

## DEFERRED / OPERATOR-PENDING

(updated for session 131)
- Supabase Free → Pro + Singapore migration.
- TAP keys (merchant approval pending).
- **Staff accounts — 13 staff emails pending from owner** (blocks
  waiter/cashier activation + the QR loyalty flag flip).
- **Resend domain verification for kahramanat.com** (transactional
  email delivery).
- **VAPID keys for driver push notifications** (Web Push subscription
  on `DriverPWAShell`).
- **`CONTACT_NOTIFY_EMAIL`** (optional — contact-form forwarding
  destination).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_QR_LOYALTY_SCAN` flip after staff accounts.
- WhatsApp/email birthday notification surface (cron + DB done;
  UI deferred).
- `/dashboard/catering` route (migration 160 + server action shipped;
  no UI).
- **P4 follow-up: ~15 `as any` sites** (AUD-V3-007/011).
- F-01 consent check (Chrome incognito → confirm GA/Clarity blocked
  pre-consent).
- Extend `localizeCheckoutError` to remaining raw-English errors.
- `HIDDEN_BRANCHES` cleanup follow-up (~30 redundant `length > 0`
  guards now that the array is empty).
- ~~`SetPasswordClient.tsx` dead-code cleanup~~ — **DONE in an
  earlier pass; carry-forward note was stale.**
- ~~`ForgotPasswordClient.tsx` dead-code cleanup~~ — **DONE
  2026-05-17 (P4-1, c4fe9a8).**
- `git push` of `c4fe9a8` (and the prior session-130 commits
  `786f549..e7ab0cb` if still local) is at operator discretion —
  Claude did not push.

## OPERATOR NOTES

- The forgot-password flow continues to use
  `@/components/auth/ForgotPasswordForm`. No user-visible change.

# Prior session 130 close-out preserved below ↓

## SESSION 130 — SUMMARY

Six commits on master. No migrations. All gates clean on every commit:
`npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx tsx scripts/check-i18n.ts` (after each i18n
touch), `NEXT_BUILD_WORKERS=1 npm run build`.

Theme: clear the dev-side backlog around the soft-launch milestone and
unblock two operator-side observability blockers. Operational hole
called out in master notes (`fn_inventory_reserve` no-op since session
38, recipes table empty) got two attacks: P2-1 ships the chef-facing
Excel import; P2-2 makes the operator-visible "X/168 mapped" banner
actionable. Loyalty surface caught up to migration 158 (birthday cron
already scaffolded — P3-1 wires the bonus value into the customer UI);
QR loyalty scanner audited and confirmed safe in flag-OFF state (P3-2).
Riffa hours corrected twice in one session — B-001 closed 01:00 → 02:00
at user request, then BUG-001 surfaced the latent opens 19:00 → 07:00
mismatch via a real-world report at 10:55 AM Bahrain. The `isOpen()`
logic was correct; the data was wrong (BRANCH_CONTACTS.md was the
source-of-truth all along). Three operator actions cleared mid-session
(SESSION_BIND_SECRET set + SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN rotated + redeploy).

## COMMITS (6 on master, not pushed by Claude — push at operator discretion)

| Hash | Type | Summary |
|------|------|---------|
| `786f549` | feat(inventory) | **Chef Excel recipes import — wires inventory deduction (P2-1).** New `/dashboard/inventory/recipes/import` route, role-gated to `owner / general_manager / inventory_manager`. Single-sheet workbook shape: `menu_item_slug \| ingredient_id \| quantity_used \| unit`. Parser in `src/lib/inventory/recipe-import-parser.ts` (UUID-format check, per-row AR+EN errors). Server action in `src/app/[locale]/dashboard/inventory/recipes/import/actions.ts` — `analyze` pass validates against `menu_items_sync` + `ingredients` and detects both in-workbook duplicates and existing `(slug, ingredient_id)` pairs already in `recipes`; `import` pass inserts the survivors via service-role with an `audit_logs` entry tagged `source: 'chef_excel_import'`. Client UI in `src/components/inventory/RecipeImportClient.tsx` follows the existing inventory dashboard card/table tokens (`brand-surface`, `brand-border`, `brand-gold`, RTL via `isAr` ternaries). "Import from Excel" CTA added to `src/app/[locale]/dashboard/inventory/recipes/page.tsx` for the same three roles. The `unit` column is intentionally informational only — the recipes table doesn't store a unit; the source of truth is `ingredients.unit`. |
| `d5da803` | feat(inventory) | **Mapped-recipes banner now actionable (P2-2).** `src/components/inventory/RecipesBannerClient.tsx` gained an `importHref` prop and a `<Link>` CTA pointing at the new P2-1 import page. `src/app/[locale]/dashboard/inventory/page.tsx`: role gate flipped from `owner / general_manager / branch_manager` → `owner / general_manager / inventory_manager`. Trigger condition tightened from `recipesCount === 0 && menuItemsCount > 0` → `menuItemsCount > 0 && recipesCount < menuItemsCount` so the banner now fires while a partial mapping is in progress. Mapped count switched from raw `recipes` row count to `DISTINCT menu_item_slug`. i18n: `recipesBanner.title` reworded; new `recipesBanner.cta` key. |
| `bfc18cd` | fix(branches) | **Riffa closing time 01:00 → 02:00 across all surfaces (B-001).** Changed only in Riffa rows — Qallali kept at 01:00. Files: `src/constants/contact.ts` (`hours.ar` / `hours.en` / `closes`), `src/lib/constants/branches.ts` (`closes_display_ar` / `closes_display_en`), `messages/ar.json` + `messages/en.json` (FAQ hours answer, Riffa segment only), `public/llms.txt` (Riffa AR + EN line), `docs/branches.md` (Riffa table Hours AR/EN + Closes). Schema.org payload: no change needed — `schemaClosesTime()` already maps cross-midnight values to `26:00`. Intentionally not changed: `023_settings_schema.sql` (generic DB default), `HoursSettings.tsx` (generic UI placeholder), `sanity/schema/index.ts` (placeholder only), `BRANCH_CONTACTS.md` (already documented `2:00 AM`). |
| `34e2da2` | feat(loyalty) | **BirthdayGiftCard reads bonus points from loyalty_config (P3-1).** Migration 158 had already shipped the column (`loyalty_config.birthday_bonus_points` default 50), the idempotency table (`birthday_point_credits` UNIQUE on `(customer_id, year)`, RLS service-role only), the RPC (`credit_birthday_points()` with idempotency-claim-first via `ON CONFLICT`, anchored to Asia/Bahrain civil date), and the `pg_cron` schedule (`0 5 * * *` UTC = 08:00 Bahrain). Items 2-4 of the brief were therefore no-ops. Item 5 wired the bonus value into the customer UI: `LoyaltyConfig` type + `DEFAULT_LOYALTY_CONFIG` fallback gain `birthdayBonusPoints`; `getLoyaltyConfig()` selects `birthday_bonus_points`; cache key bumped `v1 → v2` so older cached shapes don't satisfy the new field; account page fetches the config server-side and passes `bonusPoints` to `BirthdayGiftCard`; component renders the figure in all three states (countdown, today, prompt CTA) via locale-aware `Intl.NumberFormat`; i18n AR + EN updated with `{points}` placeholder, parity check stays at 2,394 ↔ 2,394. |
| `256b35e` | docs(flags) | **QR Loyalty scan flag audit + activation comment (P3-2).** Audit-only pass on `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_QR_LOYALTY_SCAN`. Flag stays OFF until staff (waiter/cashier) accounts are activated. Off-path verified clean: scan button (`WaiterOrderClient:263`), modal mount (`WaiterOrderClient:475`), `scannedMember` state and the `lookupMemberByQR` server action are all dead branches in the off-state; `html5-qrcode` is dynamic-imported inside the modal effect so the bundle is unaffected when off. `lookupMemberByQR` remains exported but is defended by role check (`QR_LOOKUP_ROLES`), Upstash rate limit, regex, and migration 162's `waiter_cashier_read_customer_profiles` RLS policy. `supabase migration list --linked`: 162 applied on remote. One-line activation trigger comment added next to the flag definition. |
| `e7ab0cb` | fix(branches) | **Riffa branch isOpen() — opens 19:00 → 07:00 (BUG-001).** Real-world report: Riffa shown as `مغلق حالياً` at 10:55 AM Bahrain. `src/lib/utils/time.ts` handled cross-midnight correctly via `Intl.DateTimeFormat` in Asia/Bahrain — verified all four required cases (10:55→OPEN, 01:30→OPEN, 02:30→CLOSED, 06:30→CLOSED). Root cause was stale data: `src/constants/contact.ts` had Riffa as a dinner-only branch (`opens: '19:00'`, hours.* "7:00 PM"). `BRANCH_CONTACTS.md` — the operator source-of-truth — has always shown Riffa as "Daily 7:00 AM - 2:00 AM"; the codebase was the outlier. B-001 had fixed the closing time but missed the opens field, so `isBranchOpen` kept returning false for the entire daytime window. Fan-out mirrored B-001's surface list: `src/constants/contact.ts` (opens 19:00 → 07:00, hours.ar `م` → `ص`, hours.en `PM` → `AM`), `src/lib/constants/branches.ts` (`opens_display_*`), `messages/ar.json` + `messages/en.json` (FAQ hours answer), `public/llms.txt` (Riffa hours line), `docs/branches.md` (table + Notes section). Schema.org `openingHoursSpecification` auto-rebuilds correctly because `schemas.ts` reads from `CONTACT_BRANCHES`. |

## INFRA NOTES

- **No new env vars introduced** by any of the six commits. Operator
  did set `SESSION_BIND_SECRET` + rotated `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` in Vercel
  during the session, then triggered a redeploy.
- **No migrations.** Local↔Remote still paired at 162. P3-1 consumed
  the already-shipped migration 158 (birthday gift mechanic).
- **Service-role insert path.** P2-1 uses `createServiceClient()` for
  `recipes` writes; the broader inventory import already does the
  same.
- **No new dependencies.** P2-1 reuses `exceljs` (already in deps).
- **Cache key bumped.** `getLoyaltyConfig`'s `unstable_cache` tag went
  `loyalty-config-v1` → `loyalty-config-v2` to invalidate cached rows
  lacking the new `birthdayBonusPoints` field.

## KEY DECISIONS / JUDGMENT CALLS

1. **Separate recipes-only import route instead of extending the
   existing `/dashboard/inventory/import` flow.** Existing broader
   importer expects a multi-sheet template keyed by `name_ar`. The
   chef's pending sheet is recipes-only with raw `ingredient_id` UUIDs.
   New focused route keeps the existing flow untouched.

2. **`unit` column accepted but not stored.** Recipes table has no
   `unit` column — `ingredients.unit` is authoritative. Column exists
   for chef readability and a future warn-on-mismatch check.

3. **In-workbook duplicates land in `skipped`, not `failed`.** First
   occurrence wins; rest reported as skipped — more forgiving than
   rejecting the whole import.

4. **`DISTINCT menu_item_slug` for the X/Y banner count.** Matches the
   human meaning of "X dishes have a recipe" — a dish with 5
   ingredients no longer counts as 5 toward "X/168".

5. **Banner role gate dropped `branch_manager`, added
   `inventory_manager`.** Branch managers don't author menu↔ingredient
   mappings.

6. **B-001 deliberately did not touch the DB default or
   `HoursSettings.tsx` placeholder.** Both are generic across all
   branches; flipping them to `02:00` would silently change defaults
   for any future branch row.

7. **P3-1: items 2-4 of the brief were already shipped in migration
   158.** Asked the user before reshaping rather than blindly creating
   new migrations to rename `birthday_point_credits` →
   `birthday_gift_log` or bump default 50 → 100. User confirmed
   "only do item #5". Cache key bump (`v1 → v2`) was the only side
   effect needed to surface the existing column in already-warm caches.

8. **P3-2: refused to flip the flag.** The brief explicitly forbade it,
   but the audit also confirmed there was no UI improvement to ship —
   off-state is already clean. Limited the change to a single inline
   activation-trigger comment so the next operator doesn't need to grep
   `.env.example` to find the gate condition. No empty work, no scope
   creep.

9. **BUG-001: refused to silently flip operating hours.** First
   confirmation from the user that Riffa is genuinely all-day
   (7am–2am), then applied. `BRANCH_CONTACTS.md` retroactively
   validated the choice — it had always said "Daily 7:00 AM - 2:00 AM".
   The codebase data was wrong, not the brief.

## VERIFICATION

- `npx tsc --noEmit` → clean on every commit
- `npx tsx scripts/check-i18n.ts` → 2,394 = 2,394 maintained
- `NEXT_BUILD_WORKERS=1 npm run build` → builds green on every commit
- **End-to-end of `fn_inventory_reserve` post-import is NOT verified
  in-session.** Smoke-test plan documented for operator: import one
  row, place an order on that slug, confirm an `inventory_movements`
  row with `movement_type = 'reservation'` appears (and matching
  `inventory_stock.reserved` increment) instead of an
  `inventory_alerts` row with `alert_type = 'unmapped_item'`.
- **Birthday cron** itself not verified in-session — needs a real
  birthday date in production to fire. Schema + RPC + idempotency table
  shipped in migration 158 are tested by their own constraints
  (`UNIQUE (customer_id, year)`).

## DEFERRED / OPERATOR-PENDING

(updated for session 130)
- Supabase Free → Pro + Singapore migration.
- TAP keys (merchant approval pending).
- Staff (waiter/cashier) accounts — external dependency.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_QR_LOYALTY_SCAN` flip after staff accounts.
- WhatsApp/email birthday notification surface (cron + DB done; UI deferred).
- `/dashboard/catering` route (migration 160 + server action shipped; no UI).
- `SetPasswordClient.tsx` dead-code cleanup.
- ~15 `as any` sites (AUD-V3-007/011).
- F-01 consent check (Chrome incognito → confirm GA/Clarity blocked pre-consent).
- Extend `localizeCheckoutError` to remaining raw-English errors.
- ~~Chef Excel recipe import (0/168 recipes mapped)~~ — **import
  surface now shipped (P2-1 + P2-2). Outstanding: chef hands over a
  filled `.xlsx`, operator imports, operator runs the smoke test.**
- ~~SESSION_BIND_SECRET~~ **DONE 2026-05-17.**
- ~~SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN re-rotation~~ **DONE 2026-05-17.**
- `git push` of `786f549..e7ab0cb` is at operator discretion — Claude
  did not push.

## OPERATOR NOTES

- The P2-1 import page is reachable at
  `/dashboard/inventory/recipes/import` (linked from the recipes index
  page and from the P2-2 banner on the inventory home).
- The chef's `ingredient_id` column is the UUID from the `ingredients`
  table — the page links to `/dashboard/inventory/ingredients` so the
  chef can look IDs up.
- Birthday bonus amount is tunable in `loyalty_config.birthday_bonus_points`
  (default 50, CHECK 0..10000). The UI surfaces the live value in the
  account page's `BirthdayGiftCard` in all three states.

## SESSION 129 — SUMMARY

Four commits on master, all pushed. No migrations. All gates clean on
every commit: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx tsx scripts/check-i18n.ts` (where
i18n keys changed), `NEXT_BUILD_WORKERS=1 npm run build`. One
out-of-band local environment fix (env file copy) that surfaced from a
checkout-page runtime error mid-session.

Theme: small, scoped UX fixes the user reported one-at-a-time, plus a
genuine audit task (driver notifications) that landed a real feature.
The supabase client hardening was a side-effect of the runtime error
investigation — the actual root cause was a missing `.env.local` in
the fresh tree.

## COMMITS (4 on master, all pushed)

| Hash | Type | Summary |
|------|------|---------|
| `0ae1d6d` | fix(checkout) | **Points redemption auto-cap.** Client used to redeem the full points balance value (`pointsToCredit(balance)`); server rejected with `points_over_cap` when that exceeded 50% of subtotal. UI promised a saving the server then refused. Wired `maxRedeemablePoints(balance, subtotal)` (already existed in `src/lib/loyalty/calculations.ts`) into `CheckoutForm.tsx`. New `cappedPointsToRedeem` + `pointsCapped` drive both the in-page line item AND the value sent to `createOrderWithPoints`. `LoyaltyRedemptionWidget` now takes `appliedCreditBhd` + `capped`; shows the actually-applied amount in the "saving" row plus a subtle bilingual note when capped. New i18n key `checkout.loyalty.cappedNote` (AR + EN). Widget gate also requires `cappedPointsToRedeem >= MIN_REDEMPTION` so tiny carts (sub-BHD 2) don't show a redemption that would fail the min-redemption check server-side. |
| `efe68b1` | fix(supabase) | **Actionable error when `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` env vars are missing.** `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` was using `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!` then immediately `url.includes('/rest/v1')` — when the var was undefined, the client crashed with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')`. Added an explicit presence check that throws a clear message pointing at `.env.example`. Triggered by a runtime error in `CheckoutForm.loadBranchSupport` on the user's local dev. Root cause was an out-of-band local-env issue (see Infra Notes), but the harder failure mode is worth keeping. |
| `22f7071` | fix(cart) | "إضافة المزيد" (Add more) button in `CartDrawer.tsx` was navigating to `/menu` even when the user was already on a non-empty menu page. Changed `onClick={() => { closeCart(); router.push('/menu') }}` → `onClick={closeCart}` so the drawer just closes and the user stays on whatever page they were browsing. Intentionally left intact: empty-cart "browseMenu" still navigates to `/menu` (needs a way to find items from a non-menu page), and the checkout CTA still routes to `/checkout`. `useRouter` import kept — still used by both. |
| `2079f2c` | feat(driver) | **Sound + visual notifications for new delivery orders.** Audit found existing scaffolding — Web Audio synth `playBell('ready')` from `src/lib/audio/bells.ts` (no audio files needed), `useAudioAlert` hook, realtime channel on `orders`, Web Push subscription via service worker. Gaps: one-shot sound (didn't repeat), no in-page Notification API alert, no visual cue on the new card. Added `unacknowledgedIds` Set in `DriverDashboard.tsx` — populated when `fetchOrders` detects a new ready row, drained when the driver taps the card. Drives (a) an 8s interval that replays the bell while the set is non-empty (respects mute + online state), (b) `fireBrowserNotification` using the existing `Notification.permission` grant from `usePushNotifications`, (c) a new `isUnacknowledged` prop on `DriverOrderCard` that adds `ring-2 ring-brand-gold ring-offset-2 ring-offset-brand-black animate-pulse` and an outer `onPointerDown` to call `onAcknowledge(order.id)`. No new dependencies. No audio files added. |

## INFRA NOTES

- **`.env.local` was missing in `kahramana-Saas-fresh\`.** Surfaced
  when a runtime error on `/checkout` traced back to
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` being undefined. The user's working
  `.env.local` (with real Supabase creds) still lived at the old
  `kahramana-Saas\.env.local` and wasn't carried into the fresh
  clone because `.env*` is gitignored. Copied
  `kahramana-Saas/.env.local` → `kahramana-Saas-fresh/.env.local`
  with user approval. Memory `project_working_directory_moved.md`
  appended with the "gitignored runtime files don't migrate via git"
  lesson — checked once into memory so this doesn't bite again on
  any future fresh-clone migration.
- **No new env vars introduced** by any of the four commits.
- **No migrations.** Local↔Remote still paired at 162.

## KEY DECISIONS / JUDGMENT CALLS

1. **Auto-cap rather than warn-then-block.** Could have shown the
   full points value and warned "exceeds 50% cap — adjust manually."
   Auto-cap is friendlier: the UI never promises a saving the
   server will refuse. Server-side check is unchanged — it's still
   the source of truth; the client just stops asking for too much.

2. **Sub-2-BHD carts hide the redemption widget entirely.** If
   `cappedPointsToRedeem < MIN_REDEMPTION` (200 points), the
   server's min-redemption check would reject any attempt. Easier
   to gate the widget than to show "you can't redeem here" copy.

3. **`isUnacknowledged` clears on `onPointerDown`, not on any action
   button.** Driver may want to look at the card details before
   acting. Pointer-down on any part of the card is enough; doesn't
   require pressing "Picked up."

4. **Browser Notification reuses `usePushNotifications` permission
   grant.** `Notification.permission` is shared across all
   notification APIs in the browser. Web Push permission was
   already requested via the existing gold banner in
   `DriverPWAShell.tsx`. No second prompt; if push was granted,
   in-page Notification works too.

5. **Bell respects mute, browser Notification does not.** Mute is
   for audio. Visual cue + browser notification stays on for
   accessibility (driver in headphones-off mode still gets the
   visual signal).

6. **`supabase/client.ts` hardening kept even though root cause was
   environmental.** The crash message `Cannot read properties of
   undefined (reading 'includes')` is hostile — it points at the
   wrong place. The new throw points operators directly at
   `.env.example`. Cheap defensive change.

## VERIFICATION

- `npx tsc --noEmit` → clean (4 times, one per commit)
- `npx tsx scripts/check-i18n.ts` → 2,393 = 2,393 (post-cappedNote)
- `NEXT_BUILD_WORKERS=1 npm run build` → green (4 times)
- Driver-fix commit: no manual e2e on the realtime path; logic is
  pure with the existing realtime channel as the trigger source.

## DEFERRED / OPERATOR-PENDING

(unchanged from session 128 — recap)
- `SESSION_BIND_SECRET` env var on Vercel prod + preview.
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` re-rotation.
- Supabase Free → Pro + Singapore migration.
- DNS kahramanat.com → Vercel (confirmed done in master notes;
  no action this session).
- TAP keys (merchant approval pending).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_QR_LOYALTY_SCAN` flip when staff accounts
  go live — pre-flip checklist documented in `.env.example`.
- Birthday gift cron + idempotency + `loyalty_config.birthday_bonus_points`.
- Chef Excel recipe import (0/168 recipes mapped).
- `SetPasswordClient.tsx` dead-code cleanup.

## OPERATOR NOTE

- If you migrate machines or re-clone the repo, copy
  `.env.local` (and any other gitignored env files) by hand — they
  don't ride along with `git clone` by design. The new throw in
  `supabase/client.ts` will at least tell you which file to fix.

## SESSION 128 — SUMMARY

Five commits on master, all pushed. One migration landed (162). All
gates clean on every commit: `npx tsc --noEmit`,
`npx tsx scripts/check-i18n.ts`, and `NEXT_BUILD_WORKERS=1 npm run build`.

Theme: ship a flag-OFF Waiter QR scanner without leaking any UI changes
until staff accounts go live, then immediately close the
data-correctness gap (UUID-prefix collisions on the QR lookup) and
extend RLS so the flag flip is one env-var change away from being safe.
Tail-end of the session caught two unrelated UI regressions reported
mid-session by the user, plus pushed back on a misdiagnosed driver-nav
bug.

## COMMITS (5 on master, all pushed)

| Hash | Type | Summary |
|------|------|---------|
| `3957abe` | feat(waiter) | **QR member scanner — feature-flagged OFF.** New `src/lib/feature-flags.ts` with `ENABLE_QR_LOYALTY_SCAN` (build-time, default `false`). New `lookupMemberByQR()` server action in `src/app/[locale]/waiter/actions.ts` — accepts `KAHRAMANA:KAH-XXXXXX` or `KAH-XXXXXX`, validates 6-hex, role-gated to WAITER_ROLES, 30/min/staff Upstash bucket (NODE_ENV=production gated per `feedback_rate_limit_node_env_gate`). New `src/components/waiter/QRScannerModal.tsx` — dynamic `html5-qrcode` import, rear camera, single-flight latch on first decode, RTL, tier badge via existing `TIER_COLORS` token. Wired into `WaiterOrderClient.tsx` (sidebar header button + resolved-member banner) only when flag enabled. `messages/{ar,en}.json` `waiter.qrScanner.*` keys, parity verified. `html5-qrcode` added to package.json. |
| `c07cbfd` | docs(env) | `.env.example` documents `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_QR_LOYALTY_SCAN=false` with the pre-flip checklist baked into the comment. |
| `568a6a0` | feat(db) | **Migration 162** — `customer_profiles.membership_id` STORED generated column (`'KAH-' \|\| UPPER(SUBSTRING(id::text, 1, 6))`) + UNIQUE index `idx_customer_profiles_membership_id` + SELECT-only RLS policy `waiter_cashier_read_customer_profiles`. Closes the ~16M-combo collision risk that 6-hex prefix lookup carried. `lookupMemberByQR` switched from `.filter('id::text','ilike','xxxxxx%').limit(2)` to `.eq('membership_id', 'KAH-' + upper).maybeSingle()` over RLS-aware `createClient()` (no more service-role bypass). `MemberLookupResult` lost the `'ambiguous'` code (UNIQUE makes it unreachable). Types regenerated; `Initialising login role…` + `<claude-code-hint />` stripped per `feedback_supabase_gen_types_pollution`. |
| `6babe48` | fix(inventory) | `InventoryAlertsListener` was using `Date.now()` as the React key on toast items. Two realtime `inventory_alerts` INSERTs landing in the same millisecond — or reconnect-replay re-firing buffered events — produced duplicate keys (`1778958646103` was the symptom in the report). Swapped to `crypto.randomUUID()`. DB row identity still on `item.id`; only the per-toast React key changed. |
| `b2f0555` | fix(checkout) | The "Points discount cannot exceed 50% of order subtotal" string was emitted raw-English from two sites in `src/app/[locale]/checkout/actions.ts` (early subtotal-cap check + `POINTS_OVER_CAP` RPC sentinel branch). `CheckoutForm.localizeCheckoutError` only mapped zod field codes, so the top-level `result.error` leaked through `setSubmitError` at line 422 and the `throw new Error()` at line 430. Flipped the contract: server emits the stable code `'points_over_cap'`; client maps via `localizeCheckoutError` + new `checkout.errors.pointsOverCap` i18n key. Both surface points (line 422 + 430) now route `result.error` through the mapper, so any future server code is localized — not just this one. |

## INFRA NOTES

- **Supabase link re-established.** The fresh tree had no
  `supabase/.temp/project-ref`; ran `npx supabase link --project-ref
  wwmzuofstyzworukfxkt` (kahramana-prod). State now stored under
  `supabase/.temp/` in the fresh tree.
- **Migration 015 recovered locally.** `supabase/migrations/015_production_admin.sql`
  was gitignored (`.gitignore:26`) so the fresh clone lacked it; the
  Supabase CLI refused to push 162 because remote tracked 015 with no
  local file. Copied `015_production_admin.sql` from the old
  `kahramana-Saas\` tree to satisfy the check; file remains
  uncommitted (still gitignored).
- **Local↔Remote migrations paired at 162.**
- **`html5-qrcode` added to dependencies** (1 package, 0 vulnerabilities).
- **`.agent/LAST-SESSION.md` had pending uncommitted edits** from
  session 127 close-out at the start of this session. Left in place
  (not staged in any of the five session-128 commits) to avoid
  overwriting the session-127 hand-off. This session's edits sit
  inside the same file (you're reading them now).

## OPERATOR PUSH-BACK (no work delivered, by design)

User asked to add `delivery_lat`/`delivery_lng` to seven `.select()`
calls in `src/app/[locale]/driver/actions.ts` to fix
"`customerNavUrl` falls back to DMS URL." Investigation showed:

  1. `src/app/[locale]/driver/page.tsx` `ORDER_SELECT` already
     includes both columns (line 37).
  2. Every `.select()` in `actions.ts` is **validation-only** —
     `driverBumpOrder`, `markDriverArrived`, `postDriverLocation`,
     `submitDriverIssue`, `reportDeliveryFailure`,
     `uploadDeliveryProof`, `submitHandover`. The fetched `order` is
     read for `order_type` / `status` / `branch_id` / `assigned_driver_id`
     / etc., never returned to the UI.
  3. `DriverOrderCard.tsx:251-253` (commit `20fdf58`, last session)
     already prefers `order.delivery_lat`/`order.delivery_lng` over
     `extractedUrl` from `delivery_address`.

Plausible real causes raised in the reply:
  a. `delivery_lat`/`delivery_lng` are NULL on the offending row
     (creation flow didn't persist coords — manual POS / older
     order / share-URL-only checkout). Worth a `SELECT id,
     delivery_lat, delivery_lng, delivery_address FROM orders
     WHERE id = '<bad order>'`.
  b. Turbopack browser-cache / module-registry staleness — see
     `feedback_turbopack_chrome_chunk_cache` and
     `feedback_turbopack_module_registry_stale`. Ctrl+Shift+R or
     drop `--turbopack` and run `npx next dev` once.

User has not yet replied with the order ID for path (a), so no edit
was made. **If the bug is still happening: please send the order ID
or confirm the cache route.**

## DEFERRED / OPERATOR-PENDING

(unchanged from session 127 — recap for the hand-off)
- `SESSION_BIND_SECRET` env var on Vercel prod + preview
  (`openssl rand -hex 32`).
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` re-rotation (regressed; release tagging +
  sourcemap upload 401 on `cef2850` build).
- Supabase Free → Pro + Singapore migration.
- DNS kahramanat.com → Vercel.
- TAP keys (merchant approval pending).
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_QR_LOYALTY_SCAN`** stays `false` until staff
  accounts (waiter/cashier) are activated. When flipped:
    1. Verify a real customer_profile has the expected
       `membership_id` via Studio.
    2. Re-test the QR scan flow end-to-end on a real device camera.
    3. Confirm RLS policy `waiter_cashier_read_customer_profiles`
       lets a staff session SELECT the row.
- Birthday gift cron + idempotency + `loyalty_config.birthday_bonus_points`.
- Chef Excel recipe import (0/168 recipes mapped — pending since session 38).
- `SetPasswordClient.tsx` dead-code cleanup (orphaned since session 101).

## CANDIDATE NEXT LANES (none are launch blockers)

- Diagnose the driver `customerNavUrl` complaint with a real
  order ID once the user replies.
- Apply the same `localizeCheckoutError` routing to the *other* raw
  English server errors in `src/app/[locale]/checkout/actions.ts`
  (Minimum redemption, Insufficient points balance, Coupon invalid,
  PRICE_MISMATCH, AUTH_REQUIRED, Customer session required, Order
  creation failed). Same pattern; cheap. Not in scope this session
  because the bug report named only the 50% cap message.
- Birthday gift cron follow-up.
- Inventory page banner: "0/168 recipes mapped — chef Excel import pending".

# Prior session 127 close-out preserved below ↓


## SESSION 127 — SUMMARY

Three commits on master, all pushed. One migration landed (161). No
regressions: tsc + `NEXT_BUILD_WORKERS=1 npm run build` clean on both
the migration commit and the driver-fix commit.

Mid-session discovery: the working copy at `kahramana-platform\kahramana-Saas\`
had lost its `.git` directory (cause unknown — probably an accidental
unzip-over-tree from one of the `.zip` files in the parent folder).
User created a fresh clone at `kahramana-platform\kahramana-Saas-fresh\`
and instructed all future work to happen there. Memory updated:
`project_working_directory_moved.md`.

## COMMITS (3 on master, all pushed)

| Hash | Type | Summary |
|------|------|---------|
| `2b45a6d` | fix(db) | **Migration 161** — `fn_sync_kds_on_order_terminal_status` + `trg_sync_kds_on_order_terminal_status` (AFTER UPDATE OF status ON orders). When `orders.status` transitions INTO `('delivered','completed','cancelled')`, force every non-completed `order_item_station_status` row for that order to `'completed'`. Re-fire guard via `OLD.status NOT IN (terminal)`. `bumped_at` deliberately not touched so `get_station_daily_count` doesn't show cancellations as kitchen completions. One-shot backfill UPDATE included for already-terminal orders with stale item rows. Applied to remote DB; trigger live (`pg_trigger.tgenabled='O'`), backfill query post-apply returns 0 ghost rows. |
| `dabfb87` | fix(kds) | Selector count query in `src/app/[locale]/dashboard/kds/page.tsx` now embeds `orders!inner(status)` and filters `orders.status IN ('accepted','preparing','ready')` — same window the inner station board renders. Defense in depth so selector chip counts and station-board content always match, even if a future code path bypasses the new trigger. |
| `20fdf58` | fix(driver) | `customerNavUrl` priority flip in `src/components/driver/DriverOrderCard.tsx`. Old order ran the share-URL branch first and either matched a strict decimal regex OR returned `extractedUrl` verbatim — so a customer-pasted DMS-formatted Maps URL (e.g. `?q=N 26°08'02.1" E 50°34'59.0"`) beat the clean decimal lat/lng in the DB. New order: DB `delivery_lat`/`delivery_lng` win when present (with `Number()` coercion for PostgREST's NUMERIC-as-string + `Number.isFinite` to drop NaN), then share-URL fallback, then structured-address search. Regex unchanged. |

---

## KEY DECISIONS / JUDGMENT CALLS

1. **Why migration 161 was the right shape.** The KDS ghost-count audit showed a structural mismatch: selector counted `order_item_station_status` items, board rendered `orders`. Two possible fixes — sync items→order or order→items. We already had the items→order direction (`bump_station_order` stamps `orders.ready_at`); order→items was the unwired edge. Adding the trigger closes the loop without changing query semantics on either surface.

2. **`bumped_at` left NULL on auto-completed rows.** A KDS bump and an order-cancellation force-complete are semantically different events. `get_station_daily_count` gates on `bumped_at` to compute "kitchen completions today" — sweeping cancelled-order item rows into that count would inflate the daily ops metric. The trigger updates `updated_at` (audit) but not `bumped_at` (KPI).

3. **Selector query change is defense-in-depth, not the fix.** The trigger already prevents the ghost-count condition going forward + backfill cleared the existing rows. The `orders!inner(status)` join exists so that selector and board always render the same set even if a future code path bypasses the trigger (e.g. a `delete from order_item_station_status` cleanup with no order transition).

4. **DriverOrderCard priority flip vs in-place share-URL fix.** Considered "if regex doesn't match, fall through" inside the share-URL branch. Cleaner is full priority flip: DB decimal coords are always more reliable than embedded address URLs (which are customer-typed). Share-URL still survives as the fallback for orders where checkout-GPS wasn't tapped.

5. **Working tree migrated to `kahramana-Saas-fresh\`.** When `.git` was found missing in `kahramana-Saas\`, did NOT `git init` blindly — that would have manufactured a fresh repo with no history and broken any subsequent push. Stopped, surfaced evidence, and waited for user direction. User confirmed a fresh clone was made; hash-diffed today-modified files (with `Test-Path -LiteralPath` to dodge the `[locale]` glob trap that initially produced 31 false-positive "new" files) → only the expected 2 files drifted. Copied + validated + committed in fresh.

---

## VERIFICATION

- `npx supabase db push --linked --include-all` → 161 applied
- `pg_trigger` query → `trg_sync_kds_on_order_terminal_status` on `orders`, enabled
- Ghost-row probe (terminal orders × non-completed items) → 0 rows post-backfill
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → clean (twice: post-migration, post-driver-fix)
- `NEXT_BUILD_WORKERS=1 npm run build` → green (twice)
- `npm ci` in fresh clone → 918 packages, 0 vulnerabilities

## OPEN / NEXT

- The old `kahramana-platform\kahramana-Saas\` tree is now stale and orphaned (no `.git`). User may want to delete it after confirming nothing else lives in there. Memory note exists so future sessions cd into `-fresh`.
- KDS selector should now show real counts (6/3/1 → 0/0/0 unless there's actual active work). User to verify in production.
- Driver nav: customer with `delivery_lat=26.133906, delivery_lng=50.583056` → URL is `https://www.google.com/maps?q=26.133906,50.583056`. Pasted DMS URLs are no longer fatal.

# === PREVIOUS SESSION (126) ===

> Session 126: branded confirm modal + loyalty i18n bug + البديع cleanup + founder card copy + BiDi fix + catering form hardening. Master `0675f78` → `2ef822c`.
> Date: 2026-05-16
> Author: Claude Code (Opus 4.7, 1M context)

## SESSION 126 — SUMMARY

UI + content + security session. Eight commits, all pushed. One
migration landed (160). No regressions: tsc + `next build`
(`NEXT_BUILD_WORKERS=1`) clean after every commit; i18n parity gate
green throughout (final 2,375 = 2,375).

The session went broad: a UI primitive (ConfirmModal), a runtime crash
fix on /checkout, a branch-data cleanup spanning 8 files + 2 i18n
strings, two consecutive content/styling fixes on the founder card,
and a full catering-form security hardening that lifted the form from
"wa.me handoff only" to a server-side flow with Turnstile + rate limit
+ DB persistence + branded success state.

---

## COMMITS (8 on master, all pushed)

| Hash | Type | Summary |
|------|------|---------|
| `4dd4a19` | feat | **ConfirmModal** primitive (`src/components/ui/ConfirmModal.tsx`) — branded, motion-animated, RTL-aware, `default` / `danger` variants, uses existing brand tokens + Almarai/Editorial fonts. Six callers wired: ReorderButton (cart replace), CartDrawer (clear cart), IntegrationsSettings (disconnect), PromotionsClient (delete promotion), DeliveryKanban (unassign driver), ModifiersEditor (delete option group + delete option). Every `window.confirm` in the codebase is gone (false positive remaining: `VariantPicker.confirm()` is a local function). `alert()` calls in `ImportDropzone.tsx` swapped to `toast.error()` since they're notifications, not confirmations. |
| `ad608f6` | fix | Runtime crash on /checkout. `CheckoutForm.tsx` passes `useTranslations('checkout')` into `LoyaltyRedemptionWidget`, but the widget called `t('checkout.loyalty.X')` → resolved as `checkout.checkout.loyalty.X` and threw MISSING_MESSAGE. Stripped the redundant prefix on 5 keys (needMore, balance, equivalent, toggle, saving). |
| `a2b2009` | fix | Removed every reference to the "البديع" / badi restaurant branch — 8 files: `BranchId` union narrowed to `'riffa' \| 'qallali'`, `HIDDEN_BRANCHES` left as empty typed array (~30 callers reference it), badi entries removed from `contact.ts BRANCHES`, `BRANCH_EXTENDED_DATA`, `lib/constants/branches.ts`, `BRANCH_IMAGES`, the Story `BranchesSection` Soon-card, analytics name map, and AR/EN SEO title/description. `Budaiya` in pos/OrderBuilder.tsx delivery-address picker is **NOT a branch** — kept. Applied migrations 010/013 left untouched; manual DB cleanup steps provided to operator. |
| `b537d60` | fix | Founder role copy. `story.founder.heritageLabel`: AR `"تراث عراقي"` → `"المؤسس \| مالك المطعم"`, EN `"Iraqi Heritage"` → `"Founder \| Restaurant Owner"`. Single-key change in both locale files. |
| `7c6c332` | fix | BiDi rendering for founder role text. The new `heritageLabel` value contains an ASCII pipe `\|` (neutral character) between two Arabic phrases — in LTR-leaning contexts (commit viewers, English browser tabs, ambiguous parent direction) the Unicode BiDi algorithm flips visual order around the pipe. Verified the file bytes were correct via hex-dump; fix is at the rendering layer. Added `dir={isRTL ? 'rtl' : 'ltr'}` to four nodes in `FounderSection.tsx`: both `signature` occurrences (float badge + quote block), `heritageLabel`, and `role`. Conditional because the component renders for both locales on /about. |
| `48d9285` | feat | **Migration 160** — `catering_inquiries` table for first-party catering-lead capture. Columns mirror `CateringInquiryValues` (name, phone, occasion_type, event_date DATE, event_time TIME nullable, guest_count INT 1-1000, area, service_type, preferred_branch TEXT FK→branches.id, budget nullable, notes, created_at). RLS enabled with **zero anon/authenticated policies** — only service_role writes (matching `contact_messages` / `reservations`). Explicit `REVOKE ALL ... FROM anon`/`authenticated` + `GRANT ... TO service_role` per the default-grants memory. Indexes on `created_at DESC` and partial on `preferred_branch`. Applied to remote; types regenerated and Windows pollution markers stripped per memory. |
| `e5908b4` | feat | `src/app/[locale]/catering/actions.ts` — server action mirroring `reserve/actions.ts`. Honeypot, Turnstile verify (soft-fallback when secret unset), Zod schema (guest_count coerce to int 1-1000, event_date Date.parse() check, phone 8-30, notes 1-2000), Upstash rate limit 3/IP/hour production-only, createServiceClient INSERT, returns `{ inquiryId, waLink }`. WhatsApp message title gets `#<last-8>` appended so staff can correlate WA messages with DB rows. |
| `2ef822c` | fix | `inquiry-form.tsx` rewrite: state machine `idle → submitting → success`, branded success card (mirrors ReserveForm — gold check circle, short-id, "Continue on WhatsApp" CTA, "Submit another" reset), sonner toasts for rate_limit/captcha/invalid_input/generic, Turnstile widget + honeypot, `window.open` return-value check → "popup blocked" toast for iOS Safari. GA events now fire **after** persistence. 11 new i18n keys per locale under `catering.form`. |

## KEY DECISIONS / JUDGMENT CALLS

1. **ConfirmModal API — declarative, not imperative.** Built `<ConfirmModal isOpen onConfirm onCancel />` (mirrors existing `PromptDialog`) rather than a global imperative `confirm(opts).then(...)`. Each caller manages its own state. Consistent with project pattern; no new abstraction.

2. **`window.alert()` calls in `ImportDropzone.tsx` swapped to `toast.error()`, not ConfirmModal.** Task spec said "replace all window.confirm() / window.alert() with the modal pattern" — but alerts are single-action notifications, not confirmations, and the project just adopted sonner (commit 5087b2b). Toast is the established notification pattern; confirmation modal would be overkill for "Only .xlsx files are accepted".

3. **`HIDDEN_BRANCHES` infrastructure kept even though now empty.** Referenced in ~30 files (analytics filters, KDS, payments, owner dashboard). Tearing it out would be a 30-file refactor for no functional benefit beyond cosmetics. Emptied the array (`BranchId[] = []`); existing `length > 0` guards everywhere skip the filter step correctly. Documented in commit message.

4. **`Budaiya` in `pos/OrderBuilder.tsx:231` was NOT removed.** That's a customer **delivery address area** in Northern Governorate (real Bahraini city), not a restaurant branch. Different concept; deliberately different spelling (`Budaiya` vs `Al-Badi'`). User confirmed by saying "remove all references to البديع **branch**" — emphasis on branch.

5. **BiDi fix used conditional `dir`, not hardcoded RTL.** `FounderSection` renders for both locales on `/about`. Hardcoding `dir="rtl"` would have broken the English page. Used `dir={isRTL ? 'rtl' : 'ltr'}` so English stays LTR.

6. **`guest_count` coerced to number on the client, not just the server.** First attempt used `z.coerce.number()` and sent the raw string from the form. tsc rejected it because `z.input<typeof submitSchema>` reports `number` (not `string`) as the input type for coerced numbers under our Zod version. Fixed with `Number(values.guestCount)` on the client; `NaN` from non-numeric input is caught server-side by `.int().positive()`.

7. **Catering form's `occasion_type` and `service_type` stored as localized strings, not enum keys.** Form's `<option value={t(...)}>` predates this session; values sent are the translated label (`"وليمة عائلية"` / `"Family Feast"`). DB stores `TEXT`. Not normalized; deliberately not refactored since the spec was "mirror reserve pattern" not "redesign the form". Worth a follow-up if dashboard filtering by occasion type is needed.

8. **Turnstile rendering — same `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` guard as reserve form.** No widget shown if env var absent (local dev without Turnstile keys); server-side `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` check soft-passes the same way reserve does. Soft-launch fallback is intentional.

9. **Audit-only response on reservation/inquiry form architecture (no commit).** Spent significant analysis time before commit 48d9285 explaining that the "أخبرنا عن مناسبتك" form is the **catering** form, not the reservation form — they're architecturally different. The reserve form already has full server-side stack (commit history); the catering form was deliberately wa.me-only per the existing `notice` i18n string. User then approved the upgrade, which the three catering commits delivered.

10. **Turnstile HMR error diagnosed as Turbopack module-registry bug, not code change.** A `ChevronDown` import in `menu-hero.tsx` threw `module factory is not available` in dev. Code was correct; the fix was Ctrl+Shift+R or dropping `--turbopack` (per existing turbopack memory). No commit.

---

## OUTSTANDING OPERATOR ACTIONS

1. **Manual DB cleanup of `badi` branch row.** Migration 010 + 013 seeded a `badi` row into `branches`; applied migrations are immutable. Provided SQL for the user to run in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- Inspect:
   SELECT id, name_ar, name_en, is_active FROM branches WHERE id = 'badi';
   -- Check FKs:
   SELECT 'orders' AS t, COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE branch_id = 'badi'
   UNION ALL SELECT 'staff_profiles', COUNT(*) FROM staff_profiles WHERE branch_id = 'badi'
   UNION ALL SELECT 'reservations', COUNT(*) FROM reservations WHERE branch_id = 'badi'
   UNION ALL SELECT 'payments', COUNT(*) FROM payments WHERE branch_id = 'badi';
   -- If no FKs: DELETE FROM branches WHERE id = 'badi';
   -- If FKs:    UPDATE branches SET is_active = false WHERE id = 'badi';
   ```
   User has not yet reported results.

2. **No new env vars needed.** The catering action reuses `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`, and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL/TOKEN` which are already set in Vercel for the reserve form. Same Upstash key namespace (separate Redis prefix: `catering:` vs `reserve:`).

3. **SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN re-rotation still pending** (carried from session 120). Not touched this session.

4. **SESSION_BIND_SECRET still pending** (carried from session 120). Not touched this session.

## DEFERRED / FOLLOW-UPS

- **Catering audit findings #6 + #8 not addressed.** #6 (no email fallback) and #8 (HTML5 validation balloon doesn't follow next-intl locale) are deferred. The high-priority findings (#1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #7) all shipped.

- **Catering `occasion_type` / `service_type` normalization.** Currently stored as the user's locale-rendered string. If dashboard filtering by occasion type is needed, normalize to enum keys (`familyFeast`, `majlis`, etc.) at the action layer.

- **Catering dashboard page not built.** Migration 160 + service-role action are in; no `/dashboard/catering` route or component yet. Reads exist only via direct Supabase Studio access for now.

- **`HIDDEN_BRANCHES` cleanup follow-up** (purely cosmetic): now-empty `length > 0` guards across ~30 files could be removed in a separate sweep. Not a priority.

- **B-rated audit findings #6 / #8** as above.
